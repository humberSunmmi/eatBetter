I built this web site for the information on a variety of food, restaurants, and their ordering services.

There are a variety of food from different cultures. 
However many people still confuse themselves about what they can or what they want to eat. 
I know many friends and acquaintances who are interested in Korean food. They said that 
they do not know about other country’s food, so they are afraid to try those food.  
Therefore I wish to build a website where people can introduce their culture's food, 
and where they can find help in experiencing different cultural tastes.

People who want to know about different cultures' foods, and want to order proper food, 
not junk food will use this web site. They may not have information on proper food, 
so they just end up ordering fast food to eat. So, through this web site, they can see 
what kind of food option they have, and can get to know about other country's food. 
Food is very important for health, so I want to give good information about healthy food for others.
